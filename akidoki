     Cloud Boy is the story of a young man named Jeonghan, who lives in a town that rarely sees the sunrays through the clouds. With crops dying, the town remains desolate and gloomy, but Jeonghan manages to stay optmistic, often roping the townsfolk into his games. When a thick fog settles, Jeonghan is intrigued by the glittering masses, and is swept away to an adventure that awaits him.

An excerpt:

<p>
<i>
      “Long ago, when the when it was young and fresh, The Heavens began planting seeds in the rich soil of the Earth. With each seed they planted, another animal came from the horizon to consume the fruits from the plants the seeds bore. From this came the chicken, the frog, the boar, and most importantly - mankind. However, despite them all picking from the same trees and drinking the same water, mankind developed peculiar habits. It began with them walking on their feet. Then… speaking to each other, as if they had thoughts to convey. These peculiar habits led to what you and I would call civilization. The Heavens were intrigued by this being, as it was like no other. How could they mimic The Heavens so well? The Heavens were so perplexed, they watch mankind carefully, wondering how they had concocted such a perfect recipe for their own mirror beings. As they observed, mankind were jovial, and excitable creatures. They would play games, and hunt. 
<p>
      “For thousands of years, The Heavens continued to observe. However, as time went on, mankind became restless and complacent. No matter how much they managed to learn more about the world The Heavens had created, they wanted to know even more. They began fighting wars over their observations, then accumulated a sense of greed that The Heavens had never planted. The Heavens were plagued with disgust, as these creatures clashed, enslaved, and fought in their name. How could being they created be like this? What happened to the perfect mirror?
<p>
      “With no choice, The Heavens decided that it was time to intervene. They could not let their beautiful menagerie collapse. The Heavens decided that to alleviate the sins of mankind, they must send their own down to the creatures to guide them, and teach them to remain light. For this reason, they decided that angels must walk among man, as a buffer to their peculiar habits- darn it!”
